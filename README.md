## Lab 1- Data Visualization, Data Preprocessing, and Statistical Analysis <br>

## Purpose of this Lab
The purpose of this lab is to work with a dataset and apply basic data analysis techniques using Python and Pandas. In this lab, Firstly, I loaded a customer sales dataset, cleaned the data, created visualizations, and performed basic statistical analysis. The goal was to understand how raw data can be explored and prepared before doing more advanced analysis.


## Key Insights from Visualizations and Statistics
From the scatter plot between Quantity and Sale, it was clear that higher quantities usually lead to higher sale values. This shows a positive relationship between these two variables. The histogram of Sale values showed that most sales are in the low to medium range, while higher sales are less common.  
The statistical measures such as mean, median, and standard deviation helped show the typical sale value and how spread out the data is. The correlation matrix also showed that Sale is related to Quantity and Price, but not all columns have a strong relationship.


## Challenges and Decisions
At first, I created my own CSV file, but the data output was not very useful for visualization and analysis. Because of this, I decided to find a dataset from Kaggle that already had proper numeric and categorical values. After finding a suitable CSV file, the rest of the lab was easier to complete.
